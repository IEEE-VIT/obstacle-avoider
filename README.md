Obstacle Avoider is an intelligent device which can automatically sense the obstacle in front of it and avoid them by turning itself.   

- This smart car has various features like:
  - following a straight line path,
  - following a curved line path,
  - turning left or right as per the convenience for avoiding obstacles.
- It takes input from an IR proximity or ultrasonic sensor to detect any obstacle.  
- Its speed can be controlled easily by a function.    
- It also has a Fail-safe kill switch which can be used in case of any malfunctioning of motor driver.
  - >This switch will turn off the power supply to motor driver which results in stopping the car instantly.      

On an advanced level:
You can add an IMU (MPU-6050/MPU-9050) data, to get the orientation of the bot.
   
> This project contains the sample code for arduino and image output of them used for simulation in proteus software.  
> Simply implement your algorithm and test it out in proteus or real hardware.
> Share the .ino and image files of the same for each issue that you solve.

## Getting Started ##  
- Even this pandemic can’t stop us from making hardware projects, thanks to the simulators. 
- We recommend using microcontroller based boards like Arduino,etc.
  - To get started with Arduino and it’s IDE follow this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdXQUEMOfgU&list=PLPK2l9Knytg5s2dk8V09thBmNl2g5pRSr)
- We recommend using Proteus to simulate the project and test it in case you don’t have access to the hardware components.
- Follow this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2KrMkxZQmw) to get started with how to use Proteus  
  
- Fork the repo
- Clone your forked repo and move inside it:
  - `git clone https://github.com/IEEE-VIT/Obstacle-Avoider.git`
  - `cd Obstacle-Avoider`
- Checkout to a new branch to work on an issue:
  - `git checkout -b my-amazing-feature`
- Now you can open the project and write your code
- Once you're all done coding, it's time to open a PR :) Run the following commands from the root of the project directory:
  - `git add .`
  - `git commit -m "A short description about the feature.`
  - `git push origin <my-amazing-feature>`  
  
Open your forked repo in your browser and then raise a PR to the `master` branch of this repository!
